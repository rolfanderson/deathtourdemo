\
<p>Project Mortimer is a MEmorial which remembers those who have lost their \
lives at WDW. We identify structural death necessitated by the theme park and \
put tourists face-to-face with mortality. However, the MEmorial is “not intended \
to condemn or pass judgment, but instead visualize the invisible sacrifices made \
on behalf of certain cultural or national values (xiii).” Such a high-profile \
location and iconic images like the mouse ears demands we make this point clear: \
Project Mortimer and the MEmorial genre are meant to provoke, but not insult. \
Our intentions are deathly serious. As a counter-narrative to WDW’s highly \
mediated spaces and depictions of death, Project Mortimer provides a means of \
rumination and reflection on some of the often invisible consequences of modern \
tourism and entertainment. Within composition studies, this MEmorial explores \
the possibilities of electrate writing practices distinct from literate \
memorialization. An alternative mapping with its AR counterpart furthermore \
allows us to reintroduce death as a crucial and often ignored part of the \
rhetorical process. Finally, whereas the other examples of MEmorial identify \
various deaths supporting abject communal values, the theory of death is often \
left under-examined. Our aim is therefore not to ameliorate theme park \
fatalities—the OSHA exists for that—but to enter into widely-shared community \
space consideration of what we term “Death Rhetoric.”</p> \
\
<p>Our premise in its simplest form—grad students taking on a giant \
corporation—sounds like something out of the movies, or the Old Testament. We \
wanted to say something big, could say something (we have the technology), but \
agonized over exactly why and how. Our drafts were a to-don’t list: do not \
desecrate the dead, do not insult the living, do not merely expose the skeletons \
in WDW’s closet, don’t be insensitive, don’t write a ten-thousand-word middle \
finger to Diznee. In our concern not to instrumentalize the dead, to appropriate \
tragedy for our creative or professional intents, these ethical considerations \
provided the initial basis for a methodology. Of course the dead cannot speak \
for themselves, and neither do we presume to write for them. Working through \
what not to do made clearer what our writing was trying to do. In this section \
we consider some of these ethics of mapping death, but move from ethical \
reservations towards theories of writing at the limit of existence itself. As a \
writing, not a reading, we respond to appeals from Scot Barnett and Diane Davis \
to conceive of rhetoric and composition in ways which resist containerized \
representations. Though this map gives only a crude representation of those who \
physically died at Disney, indicating their hidden presence is a step towards \
articulating the dead in a larger network of distributed identity, what Ulmer \
identifies as “avatar,” which we will return to later.</p> \
\
<p>Barnett’s “Psychogeographies of Writing” challenges compositionists to \
acknowledge and work creatively within the “limits of representation” as we \
develop new maps of writing (and write new maps). “Psychogeographies” guides \
many of the to-don’ts for this project. In one sense, this alternative mapping \
of WDW turns a smartphone into a can of spray-paint; we’re inscribing a \
corporate space with unsanctioned counter-narratives. Barnett, however, \
problematizes these rebellious assumptions: “Although attempting to unmask and \
demystify hidden power relations can satisfy in the short term, doing so also \
has the potential to leave in place the very thing we hoped to transcend—in this \
case the problem of yet another representation of space quietly asserting its \
own truth or authenticity.” Project Mortimer attempts to demystify hidden power \
relations at work in WDW, guilty. So rather than insisting on one interpretation \
of Diznee (a reading), through writing we turn our attention to “those \
irreducible aspects of embodied being-in-the-world that haunt the accounts we \
offer of ourselves but that may never find a comfortable place in the discourses \
we rely upon to represent and memorialize those accounts.”</p> \
\
<p>Critical tourism is the participation through travel in a contest for writing \
spaces. It involves the embodied experience of being-in-the-world. In light of \
Barnett’s admonishments, we must be careful not to replace one totalizing \
narrative with another. We must, in short, acknowledge the limits of critiques \
contingent upon the limits of representation.  For Barnett, citing Judith \
Butler, writing commits violence when representations expect certainty from \
their subjects. In other words, representation seeks essences. On our map you \
find indications of physical death, those who used-to-be-in-the-world. The \
challenge before us is to avoid doubling down on “ethical violence.” Barnett \
comments,</p> \
\
<blockquote>“an act of ethical violence occurs when we ask of the other the \
question ‘who are you?’ and demand in return a satisfactory response capable of \
presenting a clear and coherent image of the other’s self. Though often couched \
in the name of ethics, such acts, Butler has argued, nevertheless demand of the \
other something she cannot possibly provide—namely, an account of the self that \
is self-identical with the ‘I’ in whose name she speaks.”</blockquote> \
\
<p>Articulating death merely exacerbates writing’s failure to represent what not \
even the living other can present as a coherent self.</p> \
\
<p>Representation’s inadequacy to account for the irreducible aspects of \
being-in-the-world leads us to work against “the discourses we rely upon to \
represent and memorialize those accounts.” We treat skeptically the notion of \
simply preserving and retrieving the memory of the dead through our writing and \
mostly avoid those questions altogether. We can acknowledge the limitations of \
writing as representation, but how do we “see without knowing,” as Barnett calls \
for, and moreover, how do we write without knowing? How do we leave “open and \
unresolved the impasse between memory and the immemorial?” Barnett issues a \
challenge to which we must respond if composition is to develop alongside these \
ethical and theoretical concerns. But how in this project are we to find “a \
language that continuously interrupts the will to craft a narrative out of \
memory?”</p> \
\
<p>At this point, we offer as an interlude another prominent inquiry into death. \
The long-form journalism podcast Serial first aired in October 2014. Over 12 \
episodes, Sarah Koenig exhaustively retraces the events surrounding the 1999 \
murder of Baltimore high school student Hae Min Lee. Adnan Syed, the man \
imprisoned for the crime, insists on his innocence. Koenig weighs his claim \
against archival records, witness testimonies, and expert opinions, while \
forming a working relationship with the personable Syed. Episode one begins with \
a brain teaser: try to remember in detail what you were doing six weeks ago. If \
this task proves difficult to answer with certainty, and as Koenig’s experiment \
reveals, accounts are often revised or conflicting, consider that 1999 was 18 \
years ago at the time of this writing. Serial is a master work of investigative \
journalism, but it also offers an extended demonstration of the challenges to \
memory retrieval we work through here. The end of season one leaves personal and \
legal judgments about Adnan unresolved and perhaps unresolvable.</p> \
\
<p>Consider how often verbs like interrupts, challenges, frustrates, or leaves \
unresolved occur in academic work. Now consider one response to the Adnan Syed \
story eight episodes in: “Well then who the fuck did it?” The comment mirrors \
going down the to-don’t list. Almost instinctively we demand to know. If we’re \
not doing this, and we want to avoid saying that, then what the fuck are we \
doing? In its expletive-inducing journalistic restraint, Serial reaches the very \
limits of literate remembrance practices. Its refusal, or at least exhaustive \
diligence not to reduce the complexities of lived experience to a snappy story \
offers a model for how to leave “open and unresolved the impasse between memory \
and the immemorial.” Serial ends with a big “I don’t know,” not for certain \
anyway.</p> \
\
<p>Discussed in the previous section, emplacement forwards an ethics attuned to \
the material specifics of place, engaged locally, in detail, rather than in \
abstract tropes. It remarkably resembles a journalistic project. In our \
eagerness to memorialize those who have died in a high-profile space we risk \
yellow journalism, a kind of critical profiteering on top of a failure to move \
beyond representation. To avoid containing the irreducible complexities of lived \
experience to the obituary section of the newspaper, we must work past \
journalism as memorialization and into the theoretical possibilities of \
MEmorialization as electrate writing practice. Though we may not be able to \
substitute writing for the memory of lived experience, we want to open a \
consideration of death’s rhetoricity.</p> \
\
<p>Diane Davis echoes Butler and Barnett’s concerns: “There is no longer any way \
to pose [ontology’s] defining question, a question of uncontaminated essence: \
‘What is X?’ There is no immanent or intrinsic being, no essence in itself that \
would therefore be capable of presenting itself as such” (“A Rhetoric of \
Responsibility”). But Davis shifts the conversation from taxonomy to rhetorical \
and theoretical stakes. Drawing extensively from Jean-Luc Nancy, she identifies \
a “preoriginary rhetoricty” in the condition of distributed being. According to \
Nancy, being is always already contaminated by environs; the “singularity” of \
the individual “designate[s] precisely that which, each time, forms a point of \
exposure, traces an intersection of limits on which there is exposure. To be \
exposed is to be on the limit where, at the same time, there is both inside and \
outside, and neither inside nor outside.” This exposure, Davis says, “[Precedes] \
symbolic identification … is relationality as such; it is constitutive of being, \
which is always and only in the mode of exposition and not essence” (xx). \
Barnett’s project seeks pre-reflective aspects of being-in-the-world. Davis \
finds in the world a being-with that is always a being-for, a “solidarity that \
precedes symbolicity” (15).</p> \
\
<p>“A Rhetoric of Responsibility” makes clear the value of our project. Nancy \
writes, “[W]hat community reveals to me, in presenting to me my birth and my \
death, is my existence outside myself.” As Davis puts it, “Death marks the \
absolute limit of identification and (so) of understanding … ‘[M]y’ finitude…can \
communicate itself to me only through ‘your’ mortality.”  Project Mortimer puts \
visitors to WDW face to face with death. Nancy’s concept “face” does not refer \
to nose and cheeks and skin, nor death’s skeletal personification, but what \
Davis calls “the site of ‘my’ encounter with the inassimilable alterity of the \
other, which provokes an interruption in identification and cognition” (xx). She \
continues, “What one encounters in the face to face is the other’s finitude, the \
other’s exposedness—that is to say, both his or her mortality…” At least in \
theory, Project Mortimer pinpoints grave sites of these potential encounters, \
down to the latitude and longitude.</p> \
\
<p>We answer composition with rhetoric not to ignore ethical violence, but \
because Death Rhetoric is a constant reminder of the irreducible complexities of \
lived experience. A reminder that, Davis argues, “Responsibility kicks in as a \
response to finitude’s deadly intensity” (xx). Barnett tasks composition with \
finding ways of “seeing without knowing.” Davis replies “Thinking is not the \
same as knowing, and the challenge today, the social, ethical, and political \
challenge is to learn to think the sharing of community without effacing \
precisely this sharing by conceptualizing it, turning it into an object to be \
grasped and put to work” (8). Death depictions like the Haunted Mansion offer a \
containerized version of death without consequences. They arguably are not sites \
of encounter one’s own mortality, and certainly not intended to be. We in turn \
inscribe WDW with hidden Mortimers. Whereas a headstone marks a literate \
exercise in representation, perhaps our map markers should be thought of as \
facestones, electrate renderings of death’s finitude. Our tour challenges \
indifference, “the luxury of exposed existents who are not faced with the fact \
of their exposedness.” At these sites of encounter, “The face comes through each \
time as pure appeal, persuasion without a rhetorician” (xx). Ultimately our \
writing represents not just death, but being’s pregnant solidarity realized when \
“communal life holds itself ‘at a level equal to death.’”</p> \
\
<p>So why Disney? If we accept the existence of preoriginary rhetoricity, and \
death being the standard to which everyday life should be held, then what’s \
needed is not better representations of death in space, but more prominent \
reminders. The high-profile location is just plain good PR. Furthermore, \
attempting to invent electrate writing practices often means the playful coining \
of neologisms, “new terms to describe new things.” In our case, death’s \
rhetorical appeal means revising the term “theme park,” now suggesting inertia, \
a space of pause and recognition.</p> \
